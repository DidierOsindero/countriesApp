## <b>Description✍🏾</b>

### <b>💭What is it?</b>

An app intended to help users improve their geography skills. You can search for countries, find out their most widely spoken languages, population size and more! You can also play a quiz game where your ability to recognise flags, name capitals and guess population sizes is tested!
<br/><br/>

### <b>💭What will it be?</b>

I am in the process of building a back end for this application to store user quiz results data. The idea is that the app will be able to track which countries the user is least familiar with and tailor quiz difficulty levels to the individual user.
<br/><br/>

### <b>💭What have I learnt?</b>

Through this project I have learnt to use the useReducer React.js hook for state management; I was having to manage more complex state logic for the quiz game and discovered how useReducer can help to simplify state management. I also learnt about fetching from APIs and dealing with Javascript promises.
